# HBIT Project

*HBIT* is a project aimed at analyzing and aggregating security information about mobile devices. It consists of several components including scrapers, a web API, and a CLI application. Below is an overview of the project's structure and functionality.

## 📁 Project Structure

### 🕵️‍♂️ Scrapers

> [!TIP]
> More on scrapers in `hbit_data/README.md` file!

The scrapers gather data from various sources and store it in a structured format. The main scrapers include:

- **Security Updates Scraper**: Collects security updates.
- **iPhones Scraper**: Gathers information about iPhone models.
- **CWEs Scraper**: Collects Common Weakness Enumerations.
- **CAPECs Scraper**: Collects Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification.
- **Patches Scraper**: Collects patch information.

### 🌐 REST API

> [!TIP]
> More on REST API in `hbit_api/README.md` file!

The REST API provides access to the collected data. It is built using *FastAPI* and includes endpoints for:

- **Login**: User authentication.
- **Users**: User management.
- **Devices**: Device information.
- **Vulnerabilities**: Vulnerability information.
- **Evaluations**: Security evaluations of devices and patches.

### 🤖 AI Streamlit UI

> [!WARNING]
> Running *Streamlit UI* requires having *HBIT API* running.

To use the CLI application, run:
```sh
PYTHONPATH=. uv run streamlit run hbit/ui/security_agent.py
```

## 🚀 Installation

To install the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/TomasJani/hbit.git
    cd hbit
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:
    ```sh
    uv sync
    ```

## 📖 Usage

### 📄 Creating `.env` file

The project uses environment variables for configuration. Create a `.env` file in the root directory. You can use `.env.example` as an example and fill every `change-this`.

Some env variables are set to `change-one-of`. You will be required to fill at least one env variable in a group of these variables.

### 🚀 Starting the REST API

To start the REST API, run:

```sh
uvicorn hbit_api.api.main:api_router --reload
```

### 🛠️ Running the Scrapers

> [!WARNING]
> Running scrapers requires having *HBIT API* running.

You can run all scrapers in the correct order by calling the bash script:

```sh
bash hbit_data/scripts/run_scrapers.sh
```

To run individual scrapers, use the CLI commands provided in `hbit_data/cli.py`. For example, to scrape security updates:

```sh
PYTHONPATH=. uv run hbit_data/cli.py scrape_security_updates
```

### 💻 AI Streamlit UI

> [!WARNING]
> Running *Streamlit UI* requires having *HBIT API* running.

To use the CLI application, run:
```sh
PYTHONPATH=. uv run streamlit run hbit/ui/security_agent.py
```
